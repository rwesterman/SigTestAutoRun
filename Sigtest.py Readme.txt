Python script to run all files in a directory through Sigtest.
Script uses filters to search for correct files.  Search parameters
include a file prefix, such as "1095", a speed delineator, such as
"g3", a delineator for waveform type (clock or data), and file type
.wfm" by default.  It is recommended that clock/data types be
separated by underscores  (_d_, _clk_, etc).
The script assumes Sigtest is located in {0}'.format(path_sigtest)
\Sigtest.exe.  You can change this by editing the script with a text
editor.  You will also need to know which template and directory
the template is in.'
